//
//  IBM EGA monitor-switch readback
//
//  86Box models this as:
//
//      selector = (misc_output & 0x0c) >> 2;
//      status0  = switches & (8 >> selector) ? 0x10 : 0x00;
//
//  Keep that expression explicit here, and keep the whole register in the ISA
//  clock domain: 86Box has exactly one `egaswitchread`, written by ega_out()
//  and read by ega_in(), with nothing in between. Input Status Register 0 is
//  therefore answered here and only here (ega_top.v deliberately does not
//  decode 3C2h reads), because the video-domain copy of Miscellaneous Output
//  is several clocks behind the OUT that produced it.
//
//  The selector is captured from the live ISA cycle, not from the posted write
//  in ega_io_stretch. ROM 6277356 issues OUT 3C2h,01h and then, two
//  instructions later, OUT 3C2h,0Dh followed almost immediately by IN 3C2h.
//  The second OUT is still queued behind the first inside the stretcher when
//  the ROM asks for the answer, so a selector taken from the posted side is
//  one write old exactly for that first probe - which turns the CGA 80-column
//  pattern 0111b into 0110b, the CGA 40-column setting. Taking it from the
//  live cycle updates the selector during the OUT itself, so no subsequent IN
//  can ever see the previous value.
