//============================================================================
//
//  A video I/O read must hold the CPU until the answer can be back.
//
//  ega_io_stretch closed the write side of the crossing: a write is posted in
//  the chipset domain and presented to the video side with a guaranteed width.
//  Reads had no completion signal at all. access_ready meant "the bus is free",
//  not "the card has answered", so the CPU was released the instant a draining
//  write let go - or, for an isolated read, never held at all - and it latched
//  internal_data_bus while the answer was still crossing.
//
//  On hardware that showed up as a palette that read back wrong roughly once
//  in every 1600 bytes at the PC/AT 3.5MHz setting, and nowhere else. The write
//  side was never involved: the DAC's own write index came back exact on every
//  burst, and pacing the reads apart - same data, same comparison, only slower
//  - made the errors vanish.
//
//  The return trip is two synchroniser stages out at 28.636 MHz, the
//  two-identical-samples qualifier in ega_top, the decode, and two stages back
//  at 50 MHz. This bench does not model any of that, and does not model the
//  CPU either. It asks ega_io_stretch one question that needs neither: once a
//  read has been presented to the video domain, does access_ready stay low
//  long enough for the answer to make the journey.
//
//  The distinction the bench exists to protect is where the counter starts. A
//  read issued behind a draining write reaches the card late, so it has to be
//  given the return trip measured from when it was presented, not from when
//  the CPU raised its strobe - which is what io_settle_ticks in Chipset.sv
//  does, and why that floor alone never covered this case.
